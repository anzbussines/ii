# Google Wallet Samples

This project contains samples for using the [Google Wallet REST APIs](https://developers.google.com/wallet/) in the following languages:

* [Java](./java/README.md)
* [C#](./dotnet/README.md)
* [JavaScript (Node.js)](./nodejs/README.md)
* [PHP](./php/README.md)
* [Python](./python/README.md)

Within each language's directory, you'll find standalone samples for each of the pass types supported by the Google Wallet APIs.

Each sample demonstrates the following:

* Authenticating using a Google Cloud service account
* Creating a pass class
* Creating/retrieving a pass object
* Creating a signed JWT and a "Add to Google Wallet" URL
* Creating a Google Wallet issuer account
* Updating permissions for an issuer account
* Performing batch API calls to improve performance
